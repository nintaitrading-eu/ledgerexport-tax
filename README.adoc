Application that exports data from ledger to txt. +
It is a register report for a given tax quarter.

== Examples

For Q1, the following files will be generated: +
* reg_<date>_V001_btw_Q1.pdf +
* reg_<date>_V001_btw_januari.pdf +
* reg_<date>_V001_btw_februari.pdf +
* reg_<date>_V001_btw_march.pdf

The export is to txt-files, which are then converted to pdf files. +
This last step is needed, because the accounting software I use, does not accept txt-files.

== Dependencies

* sbcl, since this is a common lisp script. +
* vim, because that is used to transform the txt to pdf.
